Snake Game in Java
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java, using javax.swing and java.awt for graphical user interfaces and event handling. The game allows users to control a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions with the walls or itself.

Features
Classic Snake Gameplay: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.

Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall.

Graphics: Uses Java's Graphics class for rendering the snake, food, and game environment.

Key Controls: Arrow keys to move the snake.

Timer: Implements a game loop using a Timer to continuously update the game state.

Technologies Used
Java: Programming language used for the entire game logic and UI.

Swing: For creating the graphical user interface.

AWT: For handling events and graphical rendering.

Timer: Used for updating the game state at regular intervals.
